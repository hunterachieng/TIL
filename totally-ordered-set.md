# Totally Ordered Set

Involves sets which are defined in Python. A set can be of anytype according to Mathematics it can be a List.

Example ``` names = ["Hunter", "Achieng", "Synthia"] ```

Set builders are used to denote sets such as:

 `C	=	{n in Z:n is even}`
 
The above means that C = [2,4,6,8,10, ...]

 n is the element in set Z where n is even numbers
 
 therefore C is a subset of Z as it only contains the even numbers from Z
 
### Totally Ordered Set: This is a set plus a relation on the set that meets all the conditions of a partiall ordered set and the comparability condition that uses the trichotomy law.
